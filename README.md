MintFlow (**M**icroenvironment-induced and **IN**trinsic **T**ranscriptomic **FLOW**s) is a package to decompose spatial transcriptomics data into microenvironment-induced and intrinsic gene expression components. It interoperates with the [scverse](https://scverse.org/) ecosystem to enable seamless analysis workflows of spatial transcriptomics data to identify spatial biomarkers.

## Installation

```commandline
pip install mintflow
```

## Installing WandB
It's highly recommended to setup wandb when using MintFlow.

To do so:
- Go to https://wandb.ai/ and create an account.
- Create a project called "MintFlow".
